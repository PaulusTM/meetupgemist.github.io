Creating Real-life Serverless Solutions with Azure Functions

Understanding the concept of serverless solutions is the first step. The next step is to create solutions using the technologies available, like Azure Functions and Visual Studio 2017. In this session, I'll show you how to create a serverless solution using Azure Functions for a real-life scenario. This will help you in understanding the power of serverless and gives some insight on how to enable this for your own professional projects. Not only will we develop the functions, but they will also get deployed using the combined power of Visual Studio and Azure.
