Performance in the Javascript Era by Benjamin Howarth

More than just tips, tricks, metrics and clicks, from code to cloud and back again - performance on the web has gone way beyond "oh just put your CSS in the header and your Javascript in the footer".

More often approached as an afterthought, this primer will cover some essential ground on how to approach measuring website and web app performance, along with some quick wins, through to some more lower-level technical nuances with HTTP2, compression, and header management, and finally putting all our tools together to comprehensively and continuously keep a watchful eye on your performance metrics.

Topic will include ASP.NET and NodeJS samples, and slides & code will be made available on Github well in advance.
