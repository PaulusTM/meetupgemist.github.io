Azure Functions: internals and future direction - Eduardo Laureano

Azure Functions has been a popular growing service due to how simple it makes for developers, IT-pros and data professionals to build applications in the cloud.

But how does Microsoft deliver on the serverless promise? What's next for serverless and FaaS (Functions as a service)?

This talk will go through some of the most popular aspects of Azure Functions and provide details of how it works. It will also paint the picture of what's next, with some concepts demonstrated in practice.
