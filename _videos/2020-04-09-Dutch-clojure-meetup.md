It's April 2020 and the world is still under the COVID-19 pandemics. That's why we met online and had fun together discussing a couple of personal project of a couple community members.

Here's the presentations we had tonight:

4:03 Michiel Borkent -- #babashka: a #clojure-powered bag of awesomeness to make scripts development enjoyable

12:30 Michiel Borkent -- implementing an nREPL server

36:40 Kevin van Rooijen -- developing a #clojure / #clojurescript game engine on top of #integrant
