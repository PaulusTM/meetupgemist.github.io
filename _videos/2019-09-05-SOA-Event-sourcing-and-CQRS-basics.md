SOA, Event Sourcing & CQRS basics

One of the hot topics in Domain-Driven Design over the last few years has been the applications of the Event Sourcing and CQRS patterns. In this session we'll go back to basics and examine some of the motivations for event sourcing, and where it may or may not be appropriate to adopt. We'll look at companion pattern of Command-Query Responsibility Segregation, and show some of the benefits which can be derived from adopting both patterns together. We'll also look at some basic implementation patterns.
