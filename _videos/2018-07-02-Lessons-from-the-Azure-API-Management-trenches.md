Lessons from the Azure API Management trenches by Eldert Grootenboer

API Management has a lot of functionality, but it's not always clear when to use what. In this session, we will go into setting up an API Management architecture, inspired by real-life use cases. We will see how we can expose and protect our services, which policies help make our life easier, and how to handle our application lifecycle management.
