Securing Azure Operations

There are a large number of steps you can take to secure cloud workloads, but you have to know which security controls to configure. In this session you’ll learn how to secure Azure IaaS VM workloads, how to set up an Azure perimeter network and jump box architecture, how to monitor and secure Azure networks, how to delegate Azure administrator privileges, and how to get the most out of Azure Security Center, including features such as Microsoft’s cloud-based SIEM and Azure Sentinel.
