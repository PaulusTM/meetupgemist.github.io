Infrastructure as Code: Azure Resource Manager - inside out

In a fast moving software project, the demands that your application poses on itâ€™s infrastructure might change often and drastically. Are you also fed up with having to apply infrastructure changes by hand? Not to worry! In Azure there is the Azure Resource Manager, an unified API for managing all your Azure services in a declarative style.

In this session Henry Been will give you the full tour of ARM templates. Starting from scratch, we will explore how you can setup an architecture that is ready for deployment of your application code. We will touch upon syntax, manual deployment, integration with Azure Pipelines and more advanced features as nesting templates, authorizations and policies.
