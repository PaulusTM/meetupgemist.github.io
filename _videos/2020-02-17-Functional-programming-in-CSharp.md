Functional programming in C#

Functional programming has much to offer, but in time when we face and lack of developers, it is very challenging to find a lot of F #, Scala or Haskell developers. In this talk, we will slowly incorporate the main benefits of functional programming into C # with a much easier learning curve to functional concepts opposed to starting in purely functional languages as an OOP programmer.
